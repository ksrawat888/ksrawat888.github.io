# Karan Singh Rawat- Data Analytics Portfolio

**INTRODUCTION**
Hello, I'm Karan! I'm a passionate data analyst with a keen interest in uncovering insight and deriving meaningful conclusions from different types of data. I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Management Information Systems (MSIS). I developed an interest in the field of Data Analytics through my university courses. I have a curiosity to explore datasets and extract valuable insights through data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. 

In this repository, I have curated a collection of my data analysis projects that showcase my proficiency in various tools and techniques, and a commitment to delivering actionable insights. I believe that data has stories to tell, and through efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation, these stories can drive informed decision-making.

**3) SQL Project:** [Exploring data stored in tables](https://github.com/ksrawat888/Karan_Rawat-Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Portfolio.pdf)

![SQL Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksrawat888/Karan_Rawat-Portfolio/main/SQL%20Code.png)

*Goals:* This SQL project involves analyzing data from two primary tables, “People” and “States.” The “People” table contains detailed information about individuals, including personal attributes, quiz performance, and affiliations, while the “States” table provides data about different states along with their regions and divisions. I explored the data using SQL queries to get insights into participant demographics, performance trends, and state-wise distributions of the data.

*Technologies Used:* MySQL

**4) Tableau: Global COVID-19 Dashboard** [Global COVID-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karan.rawat8623/viz/GlobalCOVID-19Dashboard_17041653241670/COVID-19GLOBALVIEW#1)
